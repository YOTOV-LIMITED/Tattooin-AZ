I have been very fortunate to have be able to work with a spectacular variety of clientel whom have been my supporters and driving force to become a more talented, well rounded artist. Click here \"[link:tattoos]tattoos[\/link]\" to check out my galleries.[\/p]\n    [p]So about me, my name is Dave Urbanowicz aka \"Tattoo Dave\". I was born and raised in New Jersey and moved to Arizona in the early 90's. I started my professional career as an artist tattooing at \"Body Art Tattoo\" in Mesa, Arizona in 2002. Since then I have ventured in a solo career with the goal to open my own shop. I am a self taught artist with a drive and dedication to the art of tattooing. I am consistently studying other artists in order to improve and perfect my techniques. I do not specialize in one style alone. I enjoy them all equally; vivid color work, black and gray, traditional, portrait work, etc. I have been awarded 2 \"Best in Class\" awards at tattoo expos in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.[\/p]\n    [p]Before I tattoo any of my clients, I ensure they are happy with what he or she has decided on getting. A specialty of mine is pleasing my clients and letting them know there are many options before they make a life long commitment. Being educated and having trust in your artist will give you the art work you will be happy to live with forever.[\/p]\n    [p]Feel free to have a look around and don't be afraid to contact me for any questions you may have. Thank you for all your support and I hope you enjoy my site and art work.[\/p]\n  "}
